# Wirekite

Wirkekite is a solution for wiring up digital and analog inputs and outputs to your Mac or Windows computer. You control them with software running on your Mac or Windows computer using Objective-C, Swift or .NET.

To connect the inputs and outputs, use a [Teensy development board](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) connected via USB. There is no need to install drivers.
